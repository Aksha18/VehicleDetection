# Vehicle Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements a vehicle detection system using deep learning, specifically the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The goal is to accurately detect vehicles in images and videos with good speed and accuracy.

## Features
- Object detection using YOLO architecture
- Modular codebase:
  - Data preparation and preprocessing
  - Model training
  - Model inference (prediction)
  - Result visualization
- Fully commented code following PEP8 style guidelines
- Detailed flowcharts and explanations included in the documentation

## Repository Contents
- `code.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation, training, and evaluation.
- `best.pt` - Trained YOLO model weights.
- `README.md` - Project description and instructions.
- `docs/` - Folder containing flowcharts and project documentation.
- `data/` - Dataset and labels used for training and testing (if applicable).
- Other utility scripts for preprocessing and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/VehicleDetection.git
   cd VehicleDetection
